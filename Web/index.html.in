<h1>RKMLDevice</h1>

<p>

This is a package that allows us to create R graphics
in KML format in a manner that allows them to be displayed
on Google Earth (or Google Maps).
The idea is that we specify a geographical rectangular region
to create an R graphics graphics device We then use regular R graphics
commands to create plots.
When we close the device, the KML content to render the R graphical
elements is written to a file (or stored in an XML document).

<p> Rendering plots on Google Earth via KML is different from putting
an image as an overlay (possible via the <a href="../RKML">RKML</a>
package).  The individual graphical elements - lines, circles,
rectangles, text, etc. - are rendered and accessible individually. We
can toggle whether each element is displayed or not via the list in
the Places control.

<p>
Many more things can be done to improve this device. It serves
as a functional proof of concept. It is intended to allow
people (myself and others)  to experiment with using this medium
to display statistical results.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li> <a href="examples/sf.kmz">Time series of San Francisco
  temperature</a> Jan, 2004 - Feb, 2010
  <dd> The raw temperatures as a time series and
      a smoother time series in red.
      
  <dt>
  <li> <a href="boxplots.kmz">boxplots.kmz</a>
  <dd> This shows boxplots of temperature by month for each of three
  cities. There is a separate plot for each city, with 12 boxplots in
  each one.
      Each plot is in its own folder  within the KML.
