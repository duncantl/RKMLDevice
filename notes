Interestingly, when we display a plot from R in KML,
the elements appear in the Places in their own folder.
We can then control which ones appear. This allows us to 
highlight particular elements, e.g. smooth curves.

If we can reorganize the nodes into sub-folders
for each axis, data region, title, etc.
or for different panels in a lattice plot
